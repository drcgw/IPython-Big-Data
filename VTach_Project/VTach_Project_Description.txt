Ventricular Tachycardia Project

In this project, we are looking at mutations in a gene coding for cardiac sodium channels (SCN5A) as a possible cause of ventricular tachycardia (VTach) in some cases.

Ideally, we would be able to find ECG data for patients with VTach, analyze that ECG data, and then correlate the findings with SCN5A sequence data from those same patients. If that is not possible, our next best solution will be to find ECG and sequence data for animals with VTach (see, for example, this: http://www.pnas.org/content/99/9/6210.full.pdf). If we are not able to locate ECG and sequence data for the same animals, we can at least find sample ECG data from VTach patients and correlate that data with sample sequence data, setting up the analysis methods so that, if ECG and sequence data are collected from the same patients in the future, that future data can be easily plugged in to our code and analyzed.

Tasks to be completed:

-Collect background information, write up project (RL)
-Gather raw data for analysis, both ECG and sequence (XH?)
-Analyze ECG data (MFM?)
-Analyze sequence data (JB?)
-Correlate ECG and sequence data
-Store data/results in a database
